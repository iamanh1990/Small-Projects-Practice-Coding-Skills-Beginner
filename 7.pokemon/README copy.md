# Pokedex

I this small project, I gave a first try with React to create an Pokedex game which can show several pokemons when the DOM loaded. The ReactJS is like an onverkilled tool for this small project but the main point is I used it to practice working more with API. Eventhough I just did several GET request but it was fun.
